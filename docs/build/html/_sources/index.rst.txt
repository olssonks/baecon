Baecon Documentation
====================

**Baecon** (/ˈbiːkən/), or **Ba**\ sic **E**\ xperiment **Con**\ trol, is a Python library 
for controlling laboratory instruments to perform experiments. 

Measurement automation, in its most *basic* terms, consist of the computer 
sending a message to the instrument to change a parameter and/or get the value
of that parameter. Baecon is structed around the this by limiting the methods
used to communicate with the instrument. 

The simplicity of Baecon is partially accomplished by shifting the heavy 
lifting to the user to build the module for an instrument themselves to fit.
With users their own modules, Baecon isn't limited to any specific communication
protocol. We have a few examples of the instrument modules, and we hope to 
provide more modules user contribute there own.

Baecon operates with a command line interface or with the GUI made with
the `NiceGUI <https://nicegui.io/>`_ package.
