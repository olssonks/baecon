Welcome to the contritutions guide. To begin, create a working environment 
following the instructions below.


Creating a working environment
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

If you haven't installed ``baecon``, first follow the installation instructions
here: :ref:`readme_link`.

``baecon`` uses packages from both ``conda`` and ``pip``. It is easiest to combine these
is with a conda environment. To install ``conda`` follow the instructions here: 
`miniconda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`_. 

**Recommended**: alternitavely 
you can use ``mamba``, a drop in replacement for `conda`, which is much faster for installing 
packages. 

With ``conda`` installed (or ``mamba``), move to the ``development\baecon_environment`` directiory and 
use the following command to create the conda portion ``baecon`` environment

.. code-block:: bash

    conda create env -n baecon --file baecon_conda_env.yml
    
Next, activate the newly created conda environment ``baecon``:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda activate baecon
    
Then, install the `pip` requirements:

.. code-block:: bash 

    pip install -r baecon_pip_requirements.txt
    
**Important: You must create and activate the conda environment first, or there will
be issues with using the pip requirements.**

The environment files ``baecon_conda_env.yml`` and ``baecon_pip_requirements.txt`` only list
the explicitly need Python packages. ``conda`` and ``pip`` will install the other necessary 
packages. This allows for cross-platform combatibility, as some packages needed for the 
explicitly list packages are platform specific.

You are now ready to work on ``baecon``. Remember to activate your ``baecon`` environment 
when working on this project.

.. todo:: 
    Create test to check environment is correctly installed.
